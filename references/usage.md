# Blog Content Pipeline Usage

Use this reference when setting up the skill, choosing model channels, running
blog draft commands, or deciding whether a post needs generated images.

## Installation And Sync

Recommended standalone source:

```text
git@github.com:Drew-Z/blog-content-pipeline.git
```

Use the repository folder itself as the skill folder. Copy or sync it into a
project-local skill path when needed:

```text
<project>/.agents/skills/blog-content-pipeline/
```

Keep the copied folder shape unchanged:

```text
blog-content-pipeline/
├── SKILL.md
├── agents/
│   └── openai.yaml
└── references/
    ├── templates.md
    ├── review-and-prompts.md
    └── usage.md
```

Do not commit real relay URLs, API keys, accounts, private URLs, local secret
paths, production infrastructure details, or private metrics.

## Model Setup Before Use

Configure private model values in the consuming project, normally in
`.env.local` or an external secret store. Public repositories should only keep
placeholder variable names.

If the consuming project provides a smart-search-like model CLI, prefer it over
manual editing:

```powershell
npm.cmd run blog:model -- setup --profile strong
npm.cmd run blog:model -- status --profile strong --format markdown
npm.cmd run blog:model -- doctor --profile strong --format markdown
npm.cmd run blog:model -- doctor --profile strong --live --format markdown
```

`status` and default `doctor` should be offline and masked. Add `--live` only
when you explicitly want a minimal live request; it must not write or overwrite
drafts.

```text
BLOG_DRAFT_PROFILE=strong
BLOG_DRAFT_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_TEMPERATURE=0.65

BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_TEMPERATURE=0.65

BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_TEMPERATURE=0.35

BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_TEMPERATURE=0.2
```

Recommended profile roles:

- `strong`: long-form drafting, legacy rewrites, and style-sensitive posts. Use
  GLM-5.2, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Gemini 3.1 Pro, or an equivalent strong content
  channel.
- `fast`: outlines, summaries, topic clustering, and low-risk batch checks. Use
  Gemini 3.5 Flash or an equivalent low-cost channel.
- `review`: optional secondary review after Codex evidence and safety review.
  Do not treat model review as authority.

Default to serial model calls. Use multi-model comparison only for important
posts, style uncertainty, or disputed framing. If parallel comparison is needed,
split calls across separate relays or provider profiles.

## Typical Commands

For projects that include `scripts/generate-blog-draft.mjs`:

```powershell
npm.cmd run blog:plan
npm.cmd run blog:model -- status --profile strong --format markdown
npm.cmd run blog:model -- doctor --profile strong --format markdown
npm.cmd run blog:draft -- --slug <slug> --force
npm.cmd run blog:draft -- --slug <slug> --force --generate --profile strong
npm.cmd run blog:check
```

The scaffold command does not call a model. Use `--generate` only after the
evidence pack, safe public facts, uncertain facts, and forbidden details are
complete.

For public promotion, run the consuming project's public-content checks, for
example:

```powershell
npm.cmd run blog:audit
npm.cmd run blog:check
npm.cmd run assistant:index
npm.cmd run sitemap:generate
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

## Task Routes

- New post: choose a column, build an evidence pack, generate or write a draft,
  then review before promotion.
- Legacy rewrite: use archived text only as raw material, rebuild evidence from
  current code/docs/data, and publish only a fresh rewrite.
- Draft review: check facts, safety, column fit, project-page overlap, voice,
  image assets, and promotion readiness.
- Public promotion: convert reviewed content into the consuming project's typed
  blog data and regenerate public indexes.

## Image Generation Policy

Images are useful when they help readers understand or remember the post. They
are not required for every post, and they must not replace evidence.

Use this priority order:

1. Real project screenshots when the UI or state is safe to show publicly.
2. Self-made diagrams for architecture, data flow, workflow, and decision trees.
3. Licensed or source-attributed images for resource sharing or news context.
4. Generated images for covers, mood-setting, or abstract concepts only.

Generate images when:

- the post needs a cover or visual hook but has no real screenshot;
- the topic is conceptual and a metaphorical image helps orientation;
- the generated image is clearly decorative or illustrative.

Prefer screenshots or diagrams when:

- the post is a project case page or project-summary post;
- readers need to inspect real UI, architecture, workflow, or output;
- the image supports a factual claim.

Do not generate:

- fake product screenshots or dashboards;
- fake metrics, logs, charts, customer logos, or deployment states;
- images that imply a feature exists when it is only planned;
- copyrighted or brand-confusing lookalikes.

Every image should record:

- source type: screenshot, diagram, licensed image, or generated image;
- purpose in the post;
- alt text;
- public-safety review result;
- whether it is evidence or decoration.

Generated image prompts should be stored as draft notes when they influence a
published asset. Keep them free of private product names, customer data, private
URLs, account names, IPs, metrics, and local paths.

## Review Before Publishing

Before promoting any post:

- every factual claim traces to evidence;
- generated text has been edited by Codex or the author;
- no private details are present;
- images are labeled by source type and safe to publish;
- generated images are not presented as screenshots or evidence;
- project-page overlap has been checked;
- the final article fits its column.
